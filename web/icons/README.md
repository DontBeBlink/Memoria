# Web Icons Directory

This directory should contain the PWA icons:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These can be generated from the SVG sources in the ../icons/ directory using the icons/index.html exporter.

To generate the icons:
1. Open icons/index.html in a browser
2. Click the "192px PNG" and "512px PNG" buttons for the desired icon (e.g., memoria)
3. Save the downloaded PNG files in this directory

The PWA will work without icons, but having them improves the user experience when installing the app on mobile devices.
