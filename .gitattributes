# Enforce consistent handling of text vs binary files and preferred line endings.
# This helps avoid CRLF/LF churn on Windows and ensures binary files are not
# treated as text by Git.

# Treat all files Git detects as text; normalize to LF in repository and
# use LF in working tree as well (helps cross-platform consistency).
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicit text files that should use LF
*.py text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.md text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf

# Common binary files (do not attempt to normalize or diff them)
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.wav binary
*.ogg binary
*.mp3 binary
*.woff binary
*.woff2 binary
*.ttf binary
*.otf binary

# Ensure the attributes file itself uses LF
.gitattributes text eol=lf

# Prevent local secrets and DB from being exported in archives
server/app.db export-ignore
.env export-ignore
.env.* export-ignore

# End of file
